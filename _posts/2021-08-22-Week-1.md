Hi all. Nice to have met all of you. I hope to connect with you more this means and make this engagement more fruitful and beneficial throughout this period. Hope it can sustain.  ðŸ˜ƒ

Last week, I have face-to-face meeting with all of you (albeit virtually via zoom)

Key points to note:

* Don't be too ambitious
* Main evaluation is based on project management matters - not technical content
* To cover breadth rather than depth
* Refer to key documentation required.
